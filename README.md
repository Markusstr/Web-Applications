# Web-Applications

This repository is web-applications course project. The idea was to create a microblogging service like Twitter using fullstack Node.js JavaScript web technologies.

### Back-end

Back-end is an API made with Node.js and express. Front-end can make http requests to the back-end. Back-end uses MongoDB for storage.

### Front-end

Front-end is made with React. Users can create new accounts or login with an existing account. After logging in each users has a sessionID that is stored in the browser's cookies and in the database.
SessionID was implemented so that users don't have to login again every time they refresh the page.
